In order to extract the index.html from the llama-server for modifications, we need to start the server with some model and then run:
/usr/bin/curl -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" -X GET http://127.0.0.1:8080 > ~/index.gzip
Uncompressed gzip is a self-contained HTML which we can modify and place in WebUI resources for custom appearance.

index.gzip extracted from current llama.cpp release:
https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/tag/b6895
is provided here for reference and to diff AIChat modifications.
